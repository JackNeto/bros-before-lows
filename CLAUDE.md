# Bros Before Lows

Bros Before Lows is a Brampton-based men’s mental health initiative dedicated to reducing male suicide rates and providing accessible peer support. We’re entering 2026 with ambitious goals and need a fresh, engaging online presence to match our vision.

Objective: To redesign the existing website and capture that DIY concert flyer / community zine / local music scene energy.
