# Bros Before Lows - Research Executive Summary
## One-Page Client Brief

---

## The Organization

**Bros Before Lows (BBL)** is a grassroots men's mental health movement founded by Mathieu Harbec, operating peer support groups across the Greater Toronto Area. BBL uniquely integrates music therapy with peer-led support, offering free, judgment-free spaces for men to connect and heal.

**Current Reach:** 6 cities (Toronto, Brampton, Mississauga, Barrie, Hamilton, Kitchener) | 105 donors | $5,950 raised

---

## Key Research Findings

### Competitive Position
BBL has **two unique differentiators** no competitor owns:
1. **GTA-specific focus** - No major competitor owns this market
2. **Music therapy integration** - Completely unique in the space

### User Priorities
| User | Need | Current Gap |
|------|------|-------------|
| Men in crisis | Find help fast | Crisis resources buried, no clear path |
| Donors | Trust + transparency | No founder story, no impact report |
| Volunteers | Clear application process | "Seeking hosts" but no details |
| Sponsors | Partnership information | Nothing exists |
| Families | Resources to share | No content for them |

### Website Issues
- Homepage focused on fundraising, not finding support
- 988 crisis line buried in footer
- Founder story completely absent
- No way to find/join a peer group
- Missing pages: About, Impact, Host Application, Sponsor

---

## Redesign Priorities

### Must Have (Launch Requirements)
1. **Crisis resources visible** - 988 on every page
2. **Group finder** - City pages with meeting info
3. **Founder story** - Mathieu's "why" front and center
4. **Clear donation path** - Impact-focused giving
5. **Mobile-first design** - Crisis searches happen on phones

### Should Have (Phase 2)
6. Host application flow
7. Family resources section
8. Sponsor partnership page
9. Impact/transparency report

---

## Visual Direction Recommendation

**"Midnight Brotherhood"** - Evolved from current dark aesthetic with:
- Navy backgrounds (`#0D1B2A`)
- Teal accent (`#41B3A3`) - mental health awareness color
- Ember orange (`#E07A5F`) - warmth for donation CTAs

This maintains brand continuity while connecting to music/concert culture and feeling therapeutic rather than clinical.

---

## Proposed Site Structure

```
HOME
├── SUPPORT GROUPS (with city sub-pages)
├── EVENTS
├── ABOUT (with Founder page)
├── SHOP
└── [DONATE] ← Persistent CTA
```

**26 total pages** with crisis resources accessible from every page.

---

## Decisions Needed from Client

1. **Visual direction** - Which of 3 mood boards resonates?
2. **User priority** - Crisis users vs donors vs volunteers?
3. **Founder story** - How much is Mathieu comfortable sharing?
4. **Platform** - Stay with Fourthwall or rebuild?
5. **Timeline** - Any target launch date?

---

## Next Steps

1. **This meeting** - Validate research, capture founder story
2. **Week 2** - Wireframes for key pages
3. **Week 3-4** - Visual design concepts
4. **Week 5+** - Development and content
