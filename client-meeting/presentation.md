## Your Strengths

| Strength                    | Why It Matters                    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Grassroots authenticity** | Men trust real over corporate     |
| **Music therapy angle**     | No one else is doing this         |
| **Local GTA focus**         | Own your market                   |
| **Peer-led model**          | More accessible than clinical     |
| **Founder-driven**          | Personal story creates connection |

---

## Opportunities

1. **Founder story is hidden** - Mathieu's "why" should be front and center
2. **Crisis resources buried** - 988 needs to be visible instantly
3. **No clear path to join** - "Find a group" should be 1 click
4. **Impact not visible** - Show what donations enable
5. **Family/friends forgotten** - They need resources too

## BBL's Unique Position

**What no one else has:**

3. **Grassroots + growing** - Authentic but ambitious
4. **Peer-led simplicity** - Andy's Man Club model, Canadian
5. **Events as fundraising** - Music brings people in

**Opportunity:** Be the men's mental health organization for the GTA

**Your story is BBL's greatest asset.**
