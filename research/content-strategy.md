## 1. Current Content Assessment

### Types of Content Men's Mental Health Accounts Typically Post

Based on successful accounts in this space, the most effective content types include:

| Content Type | Purpose | Engagement Level |
|-------------|---------|------------------|
| **Personal testimonials** | Build trust and relatability | Very High |
| **Educational infographics** | Provide value, highly shareable | High |
| **Quote graphics** | Easy consumption, shareable | Medium-High |
| **Event promotion** | Drive action and attendance | Medium |
| **Behind-the-scenes** | Build authenticity and connection | High |
| **Live conversations** | Real-time engagement, depth | Medium (but high loyalty) |
| **Resource sharing** | Provide value, establish authority | Medium |

### Content Formats That Work Best

#### Reels (Highest Priority)
- **Optimal length:** 15-60 seconds for educational content, 7-15 seconds for hooks
- **Best performing:** Talking head videos, raw/authentic moments, event highlights
- **Music integration:** BBL's unique advantage - use original music and therapy sessions

#### Carousels (High Value)
- **Optimal slides:** 5-10 slides
- **Best for:** Educational content, storytelling, "myth vs. reality" posts
- **Strong for:** Save rate and share rate

#### Stories (Daily Engagement)
- **Best for:** Day-to-day connection, polls, Q&As, event countdowns
- **Use:** Interactive stickers, question boxes, "ask me anything" sessions

#### Lives (Community Building)
- **Best for:** Deep conversations, event previews, peer support demonstrations
- **Schedule:** Monthly at minimum, weekly during campaigns

### Messaging That Resonates with Men Seeking Support

**DO use:**
- Direct, action-oriented language ("Talk. Heal. Grow.")

- Strength-based messaging (vulnerability = courage)
- Real stories over statistics
- "You're not alone" themes
- Casual, relatable tone

**AVOID:**
- Clinical/medical terminology
- Preachy or lecture-style content
- Overly emotional appeals without substance
- Shame-based messaging
