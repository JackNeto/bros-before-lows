## 1. Founder Story Framework

1. **Personal struggle with mental health** - Mathieu experienced depression, anxiety, or a mental health crisis and found that traditional support systems were inadequate for men
2. **Loss of someone close** - A friend, family member, or peer lost to suicide or untreated mental health challenges
3. **Witnessing the gap** - Seeing men around him suffering in silence with no safe space to be vulnerable
4. **Recovery journey** - Personal experience with addiction recovery that highlighted the power of peer support

> [THE PROBLEM]
