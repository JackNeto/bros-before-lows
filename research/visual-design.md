# Bros Before Lows - Visual Design Direction

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Comprehensive visual design recommendations for website redesign

---

## Executive Summary

Bros Before Lows requires a visual identity that balances **masculine strength with emotional accessibility**. The design must feel authentic to its grassroots origins while projecting credibility as a growing mental health organization. This document presents three distinct visual directions, along with detailed specifications for color, typography, imagery, and UI components.

## 1. Color Palette Options

### Direction A: "Deep Trust" (Evolved Current)

Building on the existing dark aesthetic with refined, therapeutic undertones.

| Role | Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| Primary | Midnight Navy | `#0D1B2A` | Backgrounds, headers |
| Secondary | Steel Blue | `#1B3A4B` | Cards, sections |
| Accent | Healing Teal | `#41B3A3` | CTAs, links, highlights |
| Warm Accent | Ember Orange | `#E07A5F` | Donation buttons, urgent CTAs |
| Text Light | Soft White | `#F4F1DE` | Body text on dark |
| Text Dark | Charcoal | `#2B2D42` | Body text on light |

**Rationale:** Maintains the brand's established dark, serious tone while introducing teal—a color associated with mental health awareness—and warm orange for emotional warmth. The navy-to-teal transition represents the journey from darkness to hope.

**Masculinity/Approachability Balance:** Dark colors maintain strength; teal and soft whites add therapeutic calm without feeling clinical.

---

### Direction B: "Brotherhood Warmth"

A warmer, more inviting palette that emphasizes community and connection.

| Role | Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| Primary | Deep Forest | `#2D3E40` | Headers, key sections |
| Secondary | Warm Stone | `#BEB7A4` | Backgrounds, cards |
| Accent | Sunrise Gold | `#D4A03C` | CTAs, highlights |
| Supporting | Sage Green | `#8FA998` | Success states, icons |
| Warm Accent | Terracotta | `#C97C5D` | Secondary buttons |
| Text Dark | Rich Brown | `#3D3522` | Body text |
| Text Light | Cream | `#FAF8F5` | Text on dark |

**Rationale:** Earth tones evoke groundedness, stability, and natural healing. Gold represents hope and value. This palette feels like a warm gathering space—a living room rather than an institution.

**Masculinity/Approachability Balance:** Forest and stone feel rugged and grounded; warm neutrals and gold prevent coldness while avoiding stereotypically "soft" colors.

---

### Direction C: "Urban Edge"

A contemporary, high-contrast palette that connects to music culture and GTA urban identity.

| Role | Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| Primary | Pure Black | `#0A0A0A` | Backgrounds |
| Secondary | Concrete Grey | `#2C2C2C` | Cards, sections |
| Accent | Electric Blue | `#3A86FF` | Primary CTAs |
| Supporting | Neon Coral | `#FF6B6B` | Hearts/love elements |
| Highlight | Soft Lavender | `#C9B1FF` | Hover states, accents |
| Text Primary | Pure White | `#FFFFFF` | Headlines |
| Text Secondary | Silver | `#B8B8B8` | Body text |

**Rationale:** High-contrast, bold palette that connects to concert/nightlife culture. The electric blue draws attention while coral brings emotional warmth to the heart motif in the logo.

**Masculinity/Approachability Balance:** Black and electric blue feel bold and modern; coral and lavender add emotional dimension without diminishing strength.

## 2. Typography Recommendations

### Heading Fonts

#### Option 1: Inter (Recommended)
- **Google Fonts:** https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter
- **Why:** Clean, highly legible, excellent at all sizes. Has a subtle warmth that feels approachable yet professional. Variable font allows precise weight control.
- **Weights:** 700 (Bold) for H1, 600 (Semi-bold) for H2-H3

#### Option 2: Plus Jakarta Sans
- **Google Fonts:** https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Plus+Jakarta+Sans
- **Why:** Geometric with softened corners—strong but not harsh. Excellent for a modern nonprofit feel.
- **Weights:** 700-800 for headlines

#### Option 3: Outfit
- **Google Fonts:** https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit
- **Why:** Contemporary, slightly rounded geometric sans-serif. Friendly and modern without being playful.
- **Weights:** 600-700 for headlines

### Body Font

#### Primary: Source Sans 3
- **Google Fonts:** https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3
- **Why:** Adobe's open-source workhorse. Exceptional readability, especially for longer-form content about sensitive topics. Humanist design adds warmth.
- **Weights:** 400 (Regular), 600 (Semi-bold for emphasis)

#### Alternative: DM Sans
- **Google Fonts:** https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans
- **Why:** Clean geometric sans with excellent x-height for screen reading. Pairs beautifully with Inter or Outfit.

### Typography Scale

```
H1: 48px / 56px line-height (mobile: 36px / 44px)
H2: 36px / 44px line-height (mobile: 28px / 36px)
H3: 24px / 32px line-height (mobile: 20px / 28px)
H4: 20px / 28px line-height (mobile: 18px / 26px)
Body: 18px / 28px line-height (mobile: 16px / 26px)
Small: 14px / 22px line-height
Caption: 12px / 18px line-height
```

### Trust and Accessibility Through Typography

- **Generous line-height (1.5-1.6):** Reduces cognitive load when reading about emotional topics
- **No all-caps for body text:** All-caps can feel aggressive; reserve for short labels only
- **Avoid thin weights:** Ensure text always feels solid and reliable, never fragile
- **Consistent hierarchy:** Predictable structure creates safety for users in vulnerable states

## 3. Imagery Direction

### Photo Style Guidelines

#### Core Principles
1. **Authentic over polished:** Real community moments, not stock photography
2. **Diverse masculinity:** Men of different ages, ethnicities, body types
3. **Emotional range:** Joy, connection, contemplation—not just "sad men" imagery
4. **GTA context:** Urban Canadian settings, local venues, recognizable spaces
5. **Connection over isolation:** Pairs and groups, not solitary figures

#### Photo Treatment
- **Color grading:** Slightly desaturated with warm shadows (not overly filtered)
- **Lighting:** Natural or warm artificial (bar/venue lighting works well)
- **Depth of field:** Moderate—keep context visible, avoid overly "artsy" blur
- **Composition:** Subject-focused but environmental

#### Do's
- Show men talking, laughing, listening to each other
- Include concert/music event photography
- Use candid shots from actual BBL events
- Show the founder and community leaders
- Include diverse age ranges (young adults through middle-aged)
- Show vulnerable moments (hugs, emotional conversation) tastefully

#### Don'ts
- Avoid stock "depressed man with head in hands" cliches
- No isolated figures against blank backgrounds
- Avoid overly clinical/medical settings
- Don't use overly saturated or filtered images
- Avoid images that feel performative or staged
- No imagery that reinforces toxic masculinity stereotypes

### Illustration/Icon Style

#### Icon Style: Outline with Selective Fill
- **Stroke weight:** 2px consistent
- **Corner radius:** Slightly rounded (2-4px)
- **Style:** Minimalist, clear meaning
- **Fill:** Use accent color fills sparingly for emphasis

#### Key Icons Needed
- Heart (brand element)
- Speech bubble/conversation
- Group/community
- Calendar/events
- Location pin
- Music note
- Helping hand
- Shield/safety

#### Illustration Style (if used)
- **Approach:** Abstract/geometric over literal
- **Purpose:** Decorative accents, not primary content
- **Style:** Simple shapes, brand colors, subtle
- **Avoid:** Cartoon characters, overly playful illustrations

## 4. UI Component Style

### Buttons

#### Primary Button (CTAs)

.btn-primary {
  background: #41B3A3;
  color: #0D1B2A;

}
```

  color: #FFFFFF;
  padding: 18px 36px;
  border-radius: 12px;
  font-weight: 700;
  font-size: 18px;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}

/* Subtle pulse animation for urgency without aggression */

  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1);
  animation: gentle-pulse 3s ease-in-out infinite;
}

  border-radius: 8px;
  font-weight: 600;
}
```

### Cards

#### Event Card
```css

  background: #1B3A4B;
  border-radius: 16px;
  padding: 24px;
  border: 1px solid rgba(65, 179, 163, 0.2);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

  box-shadow: 0 12px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
```

  content: '"';
  font-size: 120px;
  color: rgba(65, 179, 163, 0.1);
  position: absolute;
  top: -20px;
  left: 20px;
}
```

### Forms

#### Input Fields
```css
.form-input {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  border-radius: 8px;

}

.form-input::placeholder {
  color: rgba(244, 241, 222, 0.5);
}
```

#### Newsletter Signup (Non-Pushy Approach)
```css
.newsletter-section {
  background: #1B3A4B;
  border-radius: 24px;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
}

.newsletter-headline {
  /* Inviting, not demanding */
  /* "Stay Connected" not "Subscribe Now!" */
}

.newsletter-subtext {
  /* "Get updates about peer support groups in your area" */
  /* Focus on value to them, not action from them */
}
```

### Making Donation/Signup CTAs Inviting, Not Pushy

#### Language Guidelines
- **Instead of:** "Donate Now!" / "Subscribe!"
- **Use:** "Support the Movement" / "Stay Connected"
- **Instead of:** "Don't miss out!"
- **Use:** "Be part of the community"

#### Visual Guidelines
1. **Remove urgency tactics:** No countdown timers, no "limited time" unless truly limited
2. **Soft animations:** Gentle fades, not aggressive bounces or shakes
3. **Breathing room:** Generous whitespace around CTAs
4. **Progressive disclosure:** Show impact first, ask second
5. **Multiple entry points:** Small donation options feel achievable
6. **Gratitude messaging:** "Thank you for considering supporting us"

#### Donation Component Design

## 6. Accessibility Considerations

### Color Contrast Requirements

#### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance (Minimum)
- **Normal text:** 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- **Large text (18pt+):** 3:1 contrast ratio
- **UI components:** 3:1 contrast ratio

#### Tested Combinations (Deep Trust Palette)

| Combination | Contrast Ratio | Pass/Fail |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Soft White (#F4F1DE) on Midnight Navy (#0D1B2A) | 13.2:1 | Pass AAA |
| Soft White (#F4F1DE) on Steel Blue (#1B3A4B) | 8.4:1 | Pass AAA |
| Charcoal (#2B2D42) on Soft White (#F4F1DE) | 10.8:1 | Pass AAA |
| Healing Teal (#41B3A3) on Midnight Navy (#0D1B2A) | 6.2:1 | Pass AA |
| Ember Orange (#E07A5F) on Midnight Navy (#0D1B2A) | 5.1:1 | Pass AA |

#### Color Blindness Considerations
- Test all palettes with deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia simulators
- Never rely on color alone to convey information
- Use icons + color for status indicators
- Ensure teal/green and orange/red are distinguishable through value contrast

### Font Size Minimums

| Element | Desktop | Mobile |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Body text | 18px | 16px |
| Secondary text | 16px | 14px |
| Buttons | 16px | 16px |
| Form labels | 14px | 14px |
| Captions | 12px | 12px |
| Line-height | 1.5-1.6 | 1.5-1.6 |

#### Additional Typography Accessibility
- Maximum line length: 65-75 characters
- Paragraph spacing: At least 1.5x font size
- Avoid justified text (use left-aligned)
- Ensure sufficient letter-spacing (not too tight)

### Mental Health-Specific UX Considerations

#### 1. Calming Visual Rhythm
- **Generous whitespace:** Let content breathe; don't overwhelm
- **Predictable layouts:** Consistency reduces cognitive load
- **Subtle animations:** Smooth, slow transitions (300-500ms)
- **Avoid:** Jarring movements, rapid changes, aggressive pop-ups

#### 2. Content Warnings and Safe Exits
```
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Content Note                                     |
|                                                  |
| This story discusses experiences with            |
| depression and suicidal thoughts.                |
|                                                  |
| [ Continue Reading ]  [ Return to Home ]         |
|                                                  |
| Need support? Call 988 or text HOME to 686868    |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

#### 3. Persistent Crisis Resources
- **Always visible:** 988 crisis line in footer and/or sticky element
- **Non-intrusive:** Present but not alarming
- **Multiple options:** Phone, text, chat options where available

#### 4. User Control
- **Dark/light mode toggle:** Some users need light mode for readability
- **Reduce motion option:** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Font size controls:** Allow adjustment beyond browser defaults
- **No autoplay:** Never autoplay video or audio

#### 5. Progress and Accomplishment
- **Donation confirmations:** Warm, grateful, show impact
- **Newsletter signup:** Immediate value, no guilt if unsubscribe
- **Event registration:** Clear confirmation, easy calendar add

#### 6. Language and Tone in UI
- **Avoid:** "You must," "Required," "Submit"
- **Use:** "Share with us," "Continue," "Send message"
- **Error messages:** Helpful, not blaming ("Let's try that again" vs "Error: Invalid input")

#### 7. Loading States
- **Skeleton screens:** Over spinners (less anxiety-inducing)
- **Progress indicators:** Show completion for multi-step processes
- **Instant feedback:** Acknowledge actions immediately

#### 8. Form Design for Sensitive Information
- **Optional fields clearly marked:** Don't require story-sharing
- **Save progress:** Allow users to return to long forms
- **Privacy reassurance:** Clearly state how information is used
- **Gradual disclosure:** Don't ask for everything upfront

### Accessibility Checklist

- [ ] All images have meaningful alt text
- [ ] Videos have captions and transcripts
- [ ] Site is fully keyboard navigable
- [ ] Focus states are clearly visible
- [ ] Skip links are available
- [ ] Headings follow logical hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3)

### Phased Implementation

#### Phase 1: Foundation
- Finalize color palette
- Implement typography system
- Create component library
- Establish photography guidelines

#### Phase 2: Core Pages
- Redesign homepage with new visual system
- Update donation flow
- Refresh event pages
- Create story/testimonial templates

#### Phase 3: Refinement
- User testing with target demographic
- Accessibility audit
- Performance optimization
- Dark/light mode implementation
